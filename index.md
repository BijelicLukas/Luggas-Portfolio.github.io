# Who am I?
My name is Lukas Bijelic (also known as *Luggas*), and I am currently studying Game Development at FH Salzburg in Austria.  
I enjoy solving problems, breaking them apart, rebuilding them, and sometimes overthinking them a bit too much. Luckily, game development is the perfect place for that.

# What is this?
This website showcases how I work: how I structure my projects, the challenges I encouter, and the solutions I find.  
Each project page includes technical notes, design decisions, problems I ran into, and what I would do differently today.

# Disclaimer!
I am currently in my third semester, and our GameDev-focused courses only began a few months ago.  
This means my portfolio is still growing. I'm are currently doing a Game Engine in C++ with SFML and in the upcoming semester I will work more with Unity and Unreal - and this page will grow accordingly.

# Projects

## [A.P.E - Automated Productivity Evaluation]()
A 2D sorting game developed in **C# with SFML**.  
This was my first larger game project, built around categorizing four different card types: Currency, Names, Crypto, and Humans.  
I focused on the architecture, data handling and drag-and-drop system.

## [Last Response]()
A **solo GameJam** project made in Unity.  
Theme: *Lost Signal*  
The game revolves around monitoring 9 rooms by calling the people inside. If they don't answer correclty (or something answers *for* them), you must take action and clear the room.  
I used this project to experiment with systems-driven design and enemy behavior.

## [Duck You]()
A **GameJam project** made during one of my first weeks in school.  
Theme: *Tension*  
Our idea was a 4-player couch-co-op "subway surfer".  
I implemented controller support for four players simultaneously - something completely new for me at the time.  
(There is no Itch.io page for this one)

## [Spider MOMmy]()
A **Gamejam project** developed with a small first-semester team.  
Theme: *No strings attached*  
The gamplay is split between two players:  
a first-person adventurer and a top-down spider protecting them.  
My role focused on enemy behaviour, but I also supported team members with general Unity systems and logic.
